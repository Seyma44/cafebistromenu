# Restaurant Menu React App
This is a web application built with React that allows users to view the menu of a restaurant. The application is designed to be responsive and provide a great user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

# Installation
To run the application locally, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Once you have those installed, you can follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone.
Navigate to the root directory of the project.
Run npm install to install the project dependencies.
Run npm start to start the development server.
Usage
Once you have the development server running, you can access the application in your web browser by visiting http://localhost:3000. The application will display the restaurant's menu, which is organized by categories.

Users can filter the menu items by category using the navigation menu at the top of the page. They can also search for specific items using the search bar in the top right corner of the page.

Technical Details
The application is built with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses React Router for handling navigation between pages, and Axios for making API requests to retrieve the menu data.

The menu data is stored in a JSON file, which is loaded into the application using the Fetch API. This data is then used to render the menu items and categories in the application.

The application is styled using CSS, with some additional styling provided by the Material UI library. It is designed to be responsive and work well on a variety of screen sizes.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
